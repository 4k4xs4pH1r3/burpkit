# BurpKit

Welcome to the next generation of web application penetration testing - using WebKit to own the web.
BurpKit is a BurpSuite plugin which helps in assessing complex web apps that render the contents of
their page dynamically. It has numerous features which will eventually be documented but due to
popular demand from the DEF CON 23 crowd, I have decided to make this prerelease of the code availble
with no documentation. For now you can download the JAR and load it into BurpSuite. It's as easy as
1-2-3. Open the Extender tab, select the BurpKit.jar, and click load and you're done! If successful
You'll see three extra top-level tabs in BurpSuite. Make sure you've updated your *JDK* (not JRE). 
This will ensure you're JVM has the latest WebKit implementation within the FX toolkit.
